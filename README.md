## Abstract

Sniff is a service for Denver-based dog owners looking to find friends for their lonely pups. Users have the ability to set up playdates with other users at a local dog park of their choosing. This application was built utilizing React, React Router, SCSS, ExpressJS, KnexJS, and PostgresQL.

1. The landing page of the app is a dashboard view, from which a user can view all of their scheduled past and present (upcoming) playdates
2. From this same dashboard view, a user may choose to cancel/remove any playdates from their private profile page and/or search for potential new "matches", perusing through other profiles on the site for users who present as good fits for a doggie playdate
